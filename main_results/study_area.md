# Compound Flooding Characterisation

## Study Area
The geographical focus of this study includes a region in sub-Saharan Africa particularly vulnerable to compound hydrometeorological hazards. The Keta Basin, located along the eastern coastline of Ghana, is one of the pilot sites of the EU-funded ALBATROSS project, which focuses on accelerating climate adaptation in Sub Saharan Africa by co-creating feasible and effective policy recommendations for adaptation together with local and national actors, by integrating climate services and nature-based adaptation strategies.

In order to characterise compound flooding events in the estuarine region, the focus of the analysis for the present study is placed near the Volta river mouth. The Volta Delta is located in the eastern coast of Ghana within latitudes 5°25′ and 6°20’ North and longitude 0°40′ and 1°10′ East. The delta is defined as the land below the 5 m contour in the lower portion of the Volta river basin within the Accra-Ho-Keta Plains.

This low-lying area is severely affected by coastal erosion, sea-level rise, saline water intrusion, and increasing flood risk, having experienced significant shoreline retreat over recent decades, with entire villages displaced and infrastructure lost to the sea. In fact, the Keta Basin is exposed to marine flooding events and coastal storm surges, with the Volta River estuary also influencing local hydrodynamics. The relevance of the riverine component in this context can be investigated through the characterisation of compound flooding events. This study uses a single point of reference at the Volta River Mouth (5.77°N e 0.667°E) to carry out the analysis, while a second point further north is chosen as a comparative reference for the river discharge component.
