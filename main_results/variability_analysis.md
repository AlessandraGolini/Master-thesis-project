## Time variability 

### River Discharge
The long term mean river discharge (m³/s) from 2010–2021, namely the climatology, is mapped on the GloFAS river network over south-eastern Ghana. This map shows a clear downstream increase in the mean flow along the Volta river, highlighted by the increasing intensity of the represented blue color. In fact, darker blue represents higher values of streamflow, while lighter colors show a lower discharge (such as the pale blue of the tributaries).
