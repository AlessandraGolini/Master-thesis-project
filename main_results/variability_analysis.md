### River Discharge

**River discharge climatology**

The river discharge is the volume of water flowing through a river channel, measured at any given point in cubic metres per second (m³/s) as the product of the mean streamflow velocity (m/s) and the cros-sectional area (m^2). The long term mean from 2010–2021, namely the climatology, is here mapped on the GloFAS river network over south-eastern Ghana. This map shows a downstream increase in the color intensity along the Volta river, representing a growing mean discharge as one gets closer to the coast. The colorbar shows a correspondence between the increasing intensity of blue color and the increase in average streamflow values: for instance, dark blue indicates high discharge (with a mean maximum of 1870.94 m³/s), whereas the pale blue is associated with low streamflow values (up to a mean minimum of 0.006 m³/s). Reflecting the Volta river morphology, the river discharge climatology has a spatial distribution with the highest values in the segment closest to the coast, while the lowest values occur further north, in the upstream tributaries. This is coherent with the river-network topology and the increase in contributing area toward the mouth as the land area that drains water to the river keeps getting bigger because more tributaries have joined. Whereby upstream inflows accumulate along the main stem so mean discharge rises downstream, while headwater tributaries carry lower climatological flows and greater intermittency.
